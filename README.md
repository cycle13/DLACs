# DLACs :crystal_ball:
**Deep Learning Architecture for Climate science**, in short as **DLACs**, is a python library designed to implement deep learning algorisms to climate data for weather and climate prediction. Deep learning techniques to deal with spatial-temporal sequences, namely the Convolutional Long Short Term Memory neural netwroks (**ConvLSTM**), are implemented in this package. A probabilistic version of the structure is also employed, with an easy shift from ConvLSTM to Bayesian ConvLSTM (**BayesConvLSTM**). <br/>

The module is designed to perform convolutional and recurrent operatiaons on structured climate data. <br/>

## Function
Two kinds deep neural networks structures are included by the package:
* Convolutional Long Short Term Memory neural netwroks <br>
* Bayesian Convolutional Long Short Term Memory neural netwroks <br>
